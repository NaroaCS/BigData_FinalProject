  <p><b>About</b></p>
  <p>This website has been developed by Ayaka Yamashita, Hyun-Chae Chad Loh and Naroa Coretti Sanchez as the final project for the MIT course 11.154/11.454 Big Data, Visualization, and Society.</p>
  <p>We were interested in exploring how the Covid-19 pandemic might have further increased social inequalities by hitting more those who were already vulnerable, and we were specially interested on youth because we think that living this situation at a young age can be even harder than it is for adults.</p>
  <p>This work explores some of the inequalities that we considered to have a big impact in the daily lives of youth. However, we are aware that there are many relevant factors that we are not taking into consideration and, as a consequence, in order to get a full picture for uses such as policy making, a more detailed study should be conducted with more resources and time.</p>

  <p><b>Data sources and methods</b></p>
  <div style="text-indent:20px">
  <dl>
   <dt><b><span style="font-size:14px;">Access to Food</span></b></dt>
   <dd>SNAP benefits (% households, US Census 2018) is an indicator of food insecurity. Not eating at school due to Covid-19 put more risk on the population that had problems securing food even before Covid-19.</dd>
   <dt><b><span style="font-size:14px;">Access to Playgrounds</span></b></dt>
   <dd>Using NYCâ€™s park property data, park maintenance budget data, and population data (2019), we visualized how much city budget was allotted for each open space in NYC. Covid-19 deprived access to school playgrounds from youth, and well-maintained parks became alternatives. (Note: In order only to include quality open space sufficient for supporting youth recreation, we removed not-in-quality lots with just a patch of green.)</dd>
   <dt><b><span style="font-size:14px;">Access to the Internet</span></b></dt>
   <dd>Covid-19 has changed youth education drastically from in-person to online. To understand how much NYC was prepared for this shift, we analyzed internet access data for under 18 years old (US Census, 2018).</dd>
   <dt><b><span style="font-size:14px;">Social Vulnerability Index</span></b></dt>
   <dd>We use CDC SVI, which uses 15 U.S. census variables to help local officials identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters (CDC/ATSDR 2018). In our case, it will help us to identify youth who have been vulnerable.</dd>
